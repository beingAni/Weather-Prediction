  #1 Introduction
  This project labels the 'play' attribute in a dataset . The other attributes are  'HighTemp','LowTemp','MeanTemp','HighHumd','LowHumd','MeanHumd','CloudCover'and 'WindSpeed'.The idea is that when it rains , it is not preferred to go outside and play.So , the weather data that we have can be used to build a classification model that can be used to predict whether on a given day(whose weather conditions are given) it is favourable to go outside play or not. 



  #2 Requirements
   1.You must have JDK 1.7.x or above installed on your system and 
   it should be added to your PATH variable.
   2.You should have downloaded the weka library.It can be 
   downloaded form  http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html



  #3 How to compile and run ??
   WAY 1.From NetBeans or Eclipse or anyother IDE
         Just import the project files and the weka libraries and
         run.
  
   WAY 2. From Command Line 
       From hereon 'pathlib' refers to the path to the weka libraries
       that you downloaded and 'curdir' refers to the current directory.
       
        ~$  javac -classpath "pathlib" PredictPlay.java
        ~$  java  -classpath "pathlib:curdir" PredictPlay

 

 #4 How to use ??
     We have already collected the traning data. 
     When you run the program , it'll ask you three options.
     
     Choose [1] if you want to manually enter the details of a 
     day for which you like to predict 'play'.
     Choose [2] if you want to give a testingdata in proper ARFF
     format , for which you would like to predict 'play'
     Choose [3] if you want to use our sample testingdata to
     predict 'play'.

     You can view the training data in 'weather.arff' and 
     the sample testing data in 'predictweather.arff'.
